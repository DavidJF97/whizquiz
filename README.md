## Features

### Welcome page

* Logo and Welcome
    * The site opens up to the welcome page, presenting the viewer with the quiz's logo and a warm welcome.
    * This gives the user a natural feeling starting point to set off from. The logo matched the favicon so already there is synchronicity and recognition in the design.

### Game page

* HUD and Question display
    * The games page has first and foremost a Heads Up Display the top of the screen. Followed by the current quiz question.
    * The Hud serves to display relevant information to the player. The number on the left indicates which question out of 10 they are currently playing and the number on the right is their current score. This is omportant information for the player to have so they are aware of their progress and even to aim for higher scores on replay.

* Option Buttons
    * The player is presented with the three options to answer the question with. Only one is correct. Their accuracy is indicated by the chosen option turning either green or red as stated in the "How To Play" section of the home page.
    * The color change indication works well as a visual cue to the player. Red being widely accepted as indicating "bad", "stop" or "wrong", while green is normally accepted as meaning "Good", "Go", "Okay". Due to this all player should be able to instantly identify with and understand whichever color they are presented with as they play through.
